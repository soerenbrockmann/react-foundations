# Building UI with Components

### React core concepts

There are three core concepts of React that you'll need to be familiar with to start building React applications. These are:

- Components
- Props
- State

#### Components

User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

Components allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code. If you think of components as LEGO bricks, you can take these individual bricks and combine them together to form larger structures. If you need to update a piece of the UI, you can update the specific component or brick.

#### Nesting components

Applications usually include more content than a single component. You can nest React components inside each other like you would regular HTML elements.
