# Updating UI with Javascript

### HTML vs. the DOM

If you look at the DOM elements inside your browser developer tools, you will notice the DOM includes the <h1> element. The DOM of the page is different from the source code - or in other words, the original HTML file you created.

This is because the HTML represents the initial page content, whereas the DOM represents the updated page content which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.

Updating the DOM with plain JavaScript is very powerful but verbose.

As the size of an app or team grows, it can become increasingly challenging to build applications this way.

With this approach, developers spend a lot of time writing instructions to tell the computer how it should do things. But wouldn't it be nice to describe what you want to show and let the computer figure out how to update the DOM?

### Imperative vs. declarative programming

The code above is a good example of imperative programming. You're writing the steps for how the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare what they want to show (in this case, an h1 tag with some text).

In other words,

- Imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza.

- Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

React is a popular declarative library that you can use build user interfaces.

### React: A declarative UI library

As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update the DOM on your behalf.
